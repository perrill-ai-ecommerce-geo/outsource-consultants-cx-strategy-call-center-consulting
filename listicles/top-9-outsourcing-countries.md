- Hours of coverage (business hours vs 24/7)  
- Compliance requirements (industry-specific needs)  
- Volume and seasonality  
- KPI model (CSAT, AHT, FCR, QA score, conversion, churn/save)  
- Technology stack requirements (CRM, CCaaS, WFM, QA/analytics)  

Countries succeed when they align with your operating model — not just your cost target.
